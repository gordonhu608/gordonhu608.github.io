    description: The ManiSkill 2022 Challenge is a large-scale robotic manipulation challenge that seeks to benchmark generalizable robotic agents that can interact with the 3D world like we humans do. The challenge features diverse objects and diverse task categories in SAPIEN, a fully-physical, realistic simulator.

    description: A full pose estimation
                  pipeline on the synthetic dataset. The objective is to predict object poses for all the objects of interest in
                  the scene given the image and the depth map (no semantic segmentation provided). The pipeline is to first use a segmentation network (e.g., U-Net) to segment
                  all objects in an image, and then use a learning-based method, ICP, or a combination to estimate the
                  pose for each segmented object.
