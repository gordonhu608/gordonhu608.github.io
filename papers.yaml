    description: The ManiSkill 2022 Challenge is a large-scale robotic manipulation challenge that seeks to benchmark generalizable robotic agents that can interact with the 3D world like we humans do. The challenge features diverse objects and diverse task categories in SAPIEN, a fully-physical, realistic simulator.

    description: A full pose estimation
                  pipeline on the synthetic dataset. The objective is to predict object poses for all the objects of interest in
                  the scene given the image and the depth map (no semantic segmentation provided). The pipeline is to first use a segmentation network (e.g., U-Net) to segment
                  all objects in an image, and then use a learning-based method, ICP, or a combination to estimate the
                  pose for each segmented object.

    description: We designed and implemented a recurrent neural network
                that generates captions for images in the provided dataset. This framework contains an encoder (convolutional) that takes the images as input and encode them to features; and a decoder (LSTM) that predicts and generates
                the captions. Based on the framework, several related models, including baseline
                model, Vanilla RNN and Architecture2 are configured, trained, finetuned, and tested
                based on the given CoCo dataset.

    description: In this competition, we identified and localized COVID-19 abnormalities on chest radiographs. In particular, we categorized the radiographs as negative for pneumonia or typical, indeterminate, or atypical for COVID-19. Our model will work with imaging data and annotations from a group of radiologists.This model will help radiologists diagnose the millions of COVID-19 patients more confidently and quickly.
